    <p id="demo2"><strong> WASHINGTON: Asserting that war is not an option for India and Pakistan, a top Pakistani diplomat has said Islamabad believes there is a need to resolve     all bilateral disputes, including the Kashmir issue, through dialogue .
 <span style="color:red">"Going to war is not an option at all. The reason is both the countries need economic development, have to work for the welfare of the people,"</span> Pakistan ambassador to the US Jalil Abbas Jilani  told a group of reporters here at an award ceremony held on the sidelines of the annual fall meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.</strong></p>
    <p> After five days of getting no love from Washington on the Kashmir issue, the envoys, who started their Washington trip with bluster, ended it with a whimper.
 At the start of their 5-day trip, the Pakistani envoys warned that their country would join the "China-Russia-Iran" axis if the US didn't intervene in the Kashmir issue. They even sent a message to India that they would invoke the Maoists and small rebellions in northeast India , if India continued to talk about Balochistan, TOI reported yesterday.</p>
    <p>At the end of their trip yesterday, though, the envoys struck a more conciliatory note saying <span style="color:blue">"there's no role for militancy in policy-making and non-state actors cannot be allowed to operate from the Pakistani territory,"</span> the Pakistani newspaper wrote.</p>
    <p>Mushahid Hussain Syed, one of the two envoys sent to the US to present Pakistan's case on Kashmir, said that there was complete consensus on this issue in parliament, where all parties jointly drafted a 22-point resolution asking the government to end militancy. Syed's comments came a few days after Dawn reported that the civilian government recently sent a blunt message to the country's military leadership, saying Pakistan will be completely isolated if it didn't stop cross-border militant attacks.</p>
    <p>Dawn further wrote today that diplomatic sources in Washington said the Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif's envoys <span style="color:orange"> "noticed the damage the militancy has done to Pakistan's image in general, and to the Kashmir cause in particular, and it is likely to figure prominently in their assessment of the current mood in Washington."</span></p>
    <p>Referring to the unrest in Kashmir, following the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist Burhan Wani , the news report said that <span style="color:red" >"in the US media, the Uri attack sidelined whatever sympathy the uprising" </span> in Kashmir had attracted.
