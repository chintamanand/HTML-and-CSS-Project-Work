    <p id="demo2"><strong>Considering the popularity and talent she has, it may sound unbelievable, but Sarah Jessica Parker was fired from two animated films Antz and Home on the Range.</p><br />
    <p>Sarah did "many sessions" for both of the animated movies but it was not enough to keep her spot in the cast, reported Entertainment Weekly.</p><br />
    <p> "I was fired from Antz. Apparently I was a bad ant," Ms Parker said, referring to the 1998 toon that starred Woody Allen, Jennifer Lopez, Sharon Stone, who replaced her on the DreamWorks animation movie.</p><br />
    <p> "I can't remember which movie fired me first. The first time they were like, 'We're going in a different direction.' Which I had always heard, like, as a joke," she added.</p> <br />

  <iframe width="450" height="345" align="left" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g84x-l28cLU">
  </iframe>
  <p><strong>A new memoir by Empire star Taraji P Henson claims that she was paid far less than her fellow actors, saying she was passed over for a role written for her in favour of a white colleague.</strong></p><br />
  <p>In Around the Way, she also shares that she was paid less than 2 percent of what co-star Brad Pitt received for the Academy Award winning film "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button", reports theguardian.com </p><br />
  <p>In The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Taraji played the role of adoptive mother of Brad's character, a role for which she won an Academy Award nomination in Supporting Actress category, but was forced to pay for her own accommodation costs for the shoot.</p><br />
  <p>"Both Brad and Cate (Cate Blanchett) got millions. Me? With bated breath, I sat by the phone for hours, waiting for Vince (her manager) to call and tell me the number that I thought would make me feel good: somewhere in the mid six figures - no doubt a mere percentage of what Brad was bringing home to Angelina and their beautiful babies, but something worthy of a solid up-and-coming actress with a decent amount of critical acclaim for her work," Taraji said.</p><br />
  <p> "Alas, that request was dead on arrival. 'I'm sorry, Taraji,' Vince said quietly when we finally connected. 'They came in at the lowest of six figures. I convinced them to add in a little more, but that's as high as they'd go.' There was one other thing: I'd have to agree to pay my own location fees while filming in New Orleans, meaning three months of hotel expenses would be coming directly out of my pocket. Insult, meet injury," she added.</p><br />
  <p>The actress, who is seen as Cookie Lyon in Empire season 3 in India, also picked up a pay packet far less than anticipated.</p><br />

  <a href="D:\New folder\movies.html"><span style="color:green">When Big B Met Nandamuri Balakrishna On Sarkar 3</span></a></h3>
  <iframe width="450" height="345" align="left" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jx55S7i9v3I">  </iframe>
  <p><strong>Don't blame us for being terribly excited. But that's what happens when two superstars are caught in the same frame.</strong></p><br />
<p>Amitabh Bachchan is currently shooting for the third instalment of Ram Gopal Varma's Sarkar franchise, and the recently released pictures from the set of Subhash Nagre's world are enough to keep interests piqued. So how surprised were we when prominent Telugu actor Nandamuri Balakrishna dropped by.</p><br />
<p> Soon enough, a photograph of the two in deep conversation started doing the rounds on Twitter. Apparently, Balakrishna, who is fondly known as 'Balayya' by fans was busy shooting for his highly anticipated 100th film Gautamiputra Satakarni, an epic historical saga in Hyderabad. Even though it was touted to be a casual meeting, Balakrishna reportedly flew to Mumbai at the behest of Ram. Rumour mills suggest that during the interaction, Balakrishna asked Big B to be a part of his upcoming film Raithu, although nothing is confirmed.</p><br />
<p> Meanwhile, Balakrishna and Ram have never worked together in a film. So can we hope a cameo by the Telugu star in the already star-studded Sarkar 3? Only time will tell.</p><br />
<p>Sarkar 3also stars Jackie Shroff, Manoj Bajpayee, Rohini Hattangadi, Yami Gautam, Amit Sadh, Bharat Dabholkar and Ronit Roy. Meanwhile, Gautamiputra Satakarni is slated for a Sankranti 2017 release.

 <a href="D:\New folder\movies.html"><span style="color:green">'Madhavan, Dia Mirza's Reunion For 15 Years Of RHTDM Was All We Hoped For</span></a> </h3>
    <iframe width="450" height="345" align="left" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cyX_rK4LWZw">
  </iframe> 
  <p><strong>Critics and industry experts may say otherwise, but those who were around in 2001 know that romantic comedy film Rehnaa Hai Terre Dil Mein isn't just a go-to film for millennials (and fans of Madhavan) but a cult and modern classic.</strong></p><br />
  
  <p> So, we were pretty excited when Dia Mirza, who played Reena in the film, gave us a sneak peek on Tuesday that she, alongwith Madhavan, had a little surprise in store for the fifteenth anniversary of the film.</p><br />
  <p> As promised, the two actors, who definitely don't look like they've aged a day since the release of the film (even if Madhavan proclaims that he's 15 kgs heavier), shot a two-minute video celebrating the film.
</p><br />
  <p>Of course, Madhavan started with reliving the iconic 'one flash' proposal dialogue, and Dia sang a verse of Zara Zara, endearing and giggling.</p><br />
  <p>Over the last fifteen years, and owing to repeated syndication, the film has gathered a massive fan following due to the charm of then-newcomer Dia and the brash but romantic Madhavan, cool Saif Ali Khan, witty and banterful dialogues, and timeless music by Harris Jayaraj.</p><br />
  <p>A remake of director Gautham Menon's own Tamil film Minnale, Rehnaa Hai Terre Dil Mein marked the Bollywood debut of the recently crowned Miss Asia Pacific Dia and the very well established television and Tamil film actor Madhavan. And might we say, the two actors who're really good friends in real life, still look simply adorable together. We hope you've caught the love-ly messages the two autographed for each other on the poster.</p><br />
  <p>Thanks for the throwback. All those in favour of a sequel, say aye.</p><br />
<br />

 <img src="images/shahid.jpg" alt="can't load the image" width="450" align="left"> 
 <br />
 <p><strong>Actor Shahid Kapoor, who has launched his own fashion brand recently, says there was a time when he had poor sense of fashion.</p><br />
 <p><span style="color:red">"I think I was a fashion victim 10 years back. I had absolutely no idea about what to wear or where to buy. I didn't have any knowledge of Google or social media where you could discover what's going on," </span>Shahid said in an event in Mumbai.</p><br />
 <p>He launched his fashion brand on Tuesday here, and it will be exclusively available online.
</p><br />
 <p>The actor said:<span style="color:green"> "I would wear a bright yellow T-shirt, tight jeans and boots, and thought it was cool. So, it's been a long journey. In last 2-3 years, I understood a little bit about style and wanted to express myself in the fashion line."</span> </p><br/>
 <p> Talking about the brand, the Udta Punjab star said: <span style="color:green">"The brand is something very close to my heart. It is about freedom, freedom of expression, movement and street style."</span> </p><br/>
 <p> On personal front, Shahid and his wife Mira Rajput welcomed their first child, a daughter, in August.And work wise, he will be seen in Vishal Bhardwaj's upcoming period drama Rangoon, and will soon start shooting for Sanjay Leela Bhansali for the upcoming magnum opusPadmavati.</p><br />
