    <img src="images/court.jpg" alt="can't load the image" width="450" align="left">
    <p id="demo2"><strong>NEW DELHI:</strong> The Supreme Court is all set to revisit its two-decade-old Hindutva judgement for an authoritative pronouncement on electoral law categorising misuse of religion for electoral gains as "corrupt practice".</p><br />
    <p> The seven-judge bench comprising Chief Justice T S Thakur and justices M B Lokur, S A Bobde, A K Goel, U U Lalit, D Y Chandrachud and L Nageswara Rao is likely to begin on Tuesday its crucial hearing in the matter.</p><br />
    <p> The apex court in February 2014 had decided to refer the matter to a seven judges bench.</p><br />
    <p> The issue assumes importance as questions were raised on its 1995 verdict which held that vote in name of <span style="color:orange">"Hindutva/ Hinduism" </span> did not prejudicially affect any candidate and since then three election petitions are pending on the subject in the apex court.</p> <br />
    <p>The apex court's three-judge bench in 1995 had held that <span style="color:violet">"Hindutva/Hinduism is a way of life of the people in the sub-continent" and "is a state of mind".</span></p><br />
    <p>The judgement was delivered in the case of Manohar Joshi versus N B Patil which was authored by Justice J S Verma who found that statement by Joshi that <span style="color:red">"First Hindu State will be established in Maharashtra did not amount to appeal on ground of religion"</span></p><br />
    <p>The observation was made while dealing with the question regarding the scope of corrupt practices mentioned in sub-section (3) of Section 123 of the 1951 Representation of People Act.</p><br />
    <p>The issue for interpretation of sub-section (3) of Section 123 of the Act once again had come on January 30, 2014 (Friday) before a five-judge which referred it for examination before a larger bench of seven judges. </p><br />
    <p> The seven judges would be dealing with the appeal filed in 1992 by BJP leader Abhiram Singh, whose election to 1990 Maharashtra Assembly was set aside in 1991 by the Bombay high court.</p><br />
    <p> A three-judge bench on April 16, 1992 had referred Singh's appeal in which the same question and interpretation of sub-section (3) of Section 123 of the Act was raised to a five-judge Constitution Bench.</p> <br />
    <p> While the five-judge bench was hearing this matter on January 30, 2014 it was informed that an identical issue was raised in the election petition filed by one Narayan Singh against BJP leader Sunderlal Patwa and the apex court's another Constitution Bench of five Judges has referred it to a larger bench of seven Judges.</p><br />
    <p> Thereafter, the five-judge bench had referred Singh's matter also to the Chief Justice for placing it before a seven-judge bench.</p><br />
    <p> The January 30, 2014, order said, <span style="color:green">"Be that as it may, since one of the questions involved in the present appeal is already referred to a larger bench of seven judges,</span> we think it appropriate to refer this appeal to a limited extent regarding interpretation of sub-section (3) of Section 123 of the 1951 Act to a larger bench of seven judges.</p><br />
    <p> <span style="color:orange"> "The Registry will place the matter before the Chief Justice for constitution of a bench of seven judges. The matter may be listed subject to the order of the Chief Justice."</span></p><br />
    <p> The apex court had also noted, "In the course of arguments, our attention has been invited to the order of this court dated August 20, 2002 in Narayan Singh vs Sunderlal Patwa. By this order, a Constitution Bench of five judges has referred the question regarding the scope of corrupt practice mentioned in sub-section (3) of Section 123 of the 1951 Act to a larger bench of seven judges.</p>
    <p> <span style="color:pink"> "This became necessary in view of the earlier decision of a Constitution Bench of this court in Kultar Singh vs Mukhtiar Singh," </span> the court had said.</p>

  <p><strong>NEW DELHI: One soldier was martyred on Sunday as Pakistani troops violated ceasefire in Rajouri district of Jammu and Kashmir.</strong></p><br />
  <p>The Pakistani troops resorted to unprovoked firing at Indian positions.</p><br />
  <p> Pakistani troops have violated ceasefire at the Line of Control several times after the Army conducted surgical strikes to attack terror camps across the border.</p><br />
  <p> Earlier in the day, Pakistan opened fire at Indian posts along the Line of Control+ in Uri sector, mere two days after the terror attack which claimed lives of 18 security personnel. This ceasefire violation on Pakistan's part comes even as countries around the world continue to condemn Sunday's attack.</p><br />
  <p> On Sunday, Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists attacked an army camp in Uri+ , killing 18 soldiers and injuring around 20, in a suicide attack. Four terrorists struck the camp close to the headquarters of the 12th Brigade at Uri in Baramulla District. It was one of the deadliest terrorist strikes on security forces in recent times. The place where the attack took place is located barely 6km from the Line of Control.</p><br />
  <p> After the Uri attack on Sunday, India blamed Pakistan for the act and the Army has come down heavily on Islamabad, saying it will 'give a befitting response+ ' to the attack at a time and place of its own choosing.</p><br />
  <p> Pakistan, on the other hand, has denied all allegations even as India claimed to have plenty of evidence to support its claim.</p>

  <p><strong>VARANASI: Holding the district administration responsible for the stampede that claimed 25 lives, the BJP state president Keshav Prasad Maurya accused the administration of not taking action against the organisers due to the closeness of Pankaj Maharaj with UP minister Shivpal Singh Yadav.
</strong></p><br />
<p><span style="color:red">"Pankaj Baba is known for his closeness to chief minister Akhilesh Yadav's uncle Shivpal Singh Yadav due to which the government is not taking any concrete action. The CM is worrying about the next budget, when Varanasi witnessed such a big tragedy," </span>said Maurya, who was here on Sunday to see the injured persons at the BHU trauma centre. He further said that it is the fear of Shivpal Yadav that the district administration is taking no action.</p><br />
<p> The Union minister of labour and employment Bandaru Dattatreya also went to trauma centre and met the injured persons. Dattatreya, holding negligence of state government responsible for the deaths in stampede, said that a high-level probe should be instituted to investigate the matter.</p><br />
<p> He said that he will apprise Union home minister Rajnath Singh of the situation. The Congress leaders, including the UP chief ministerial candidate Sheila Dixit and state president Raj Babbar, are arriving here on Monday to see the injured persons.</p><br />
<p> Union minister of state for HRD Mahendra Nath Pandey and UP Tourism Minister Om Prakash Singh already met the injured persons on Saturday.</p><br />

  <p><strong>NEW DELHI: On Sunday morning, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called Pakistan 'mother-ship of terrorism'+ . In the evening, he once again slammed Islamabad and said that 'terror has become its favourite child'. These two strongly-worded statements against Pakistan in a single day reiterate New Delhi's resolve to isolate Pakistan internationally for supporting cross-border terrorism.</strong></p><br />
  <p> <span style="color:red">"Terrorism has become its favourite child, and the child in turn has come to define the essential nature of its parents," </span>PM said, unleashing a blistering attack at Pakistan. He was addressing the head of states of BRICS and BIMSTEC at the first-ever Outreach Summit.</p><br />
  <p> In his second strongly-worded statement against Pakistan in the day, PM said,<span style="color:green"> "In south Asia and BIMSTEC, all nation states 'barring one' are motivated to pursue a path of peace, development and economic prosperity in the region".</span> He singled-out the country without mentioning its name and added, <span style="color:orange">"Unfortunately, this country in India's neighbourhood embraces and radiates the darkness of terrorism".</span></p><br />
  <p> Earlier in the day, the PM had come down heavily on Pakistan and its support to state-sponsored terrorism+ . In a vehement attack at India's neighbour during a meeting with the BRICS leaders+ , he termed Pakistan a 'mother-ship of terrorism'.</p><br />
  <p> <span style="color:pink">"In our own region, terrorism poses a grave threat to peace, security and development. Tragically, the mother-ship of terrorism is a country in India's neighbourhood. Terror modules around the world are linked to this mother-ship," </span>the PM said at the Leaders' Restricted Meeting.</p><br />
  <p> At the BRICS-BIMSTEC Outreach Summit, PM also issued a strong warning to those who nurture the ''philosophy of terrorism''. In his hard-hitting speech, the PM said that 'they must mend their way or face isolation in the civilized world'.</p><br />
  <p> Addressing all the leaders of the South Asian region, PM Modi also called on the member states to stand united and act against terror in the region. <span style="color:red">"Now is the time to stand up and act; and act boldly," </span> he said.</p><br />
  <p> The grouping, which is united by similar challenges and limitations, must act against terrorism, radicalisation, and trans-national crimes which pose a great threat to the region, the PM also said.</p><br />
  <p> The Modi-led government has taken every opportunity since the Uri terror attack+ to push the cross-border terrorism issue at international platforms. Without mentioning the name of the country, the Prime Minister has delivered numerous stingers aimed at Islamabad in a bid to isolate the country internationally.</p><br />

 <br />
 <p><strong>HISAR: BJP President Amit Shah today said the Narendra Modi government has taken steps to secure the country's borders and pursued policies which have made India the fastest growing economy in the world</strong></p><br />
 <p><span style="color:red">"The Modi government has taken steps to secure the country's borders," </span>Shah said addressing a public gathering on the occasion of 35th annual fair at Agroha Dham here, an event organised by Agroha Vikas Trust.</p><br />
 <p>Shah, who was the chief guest at the function here, referred to Lance Naik Hemraj who was killed and then beheaded by Pakistani soldiers in 2013.</p><br />
 <p><span style="color:green">"Under the NDA government led by Narendra Modi, no one will dare insult our martyrs like Hemraj. No one can dare commit any misadventure and our brave forces, due to the government's strong political will, are ready to meet all challenges,"</span> he said. </p><br/>
 <p>On the Goods and Services Tax, Shah said Sales Tax, VAT, Octroi, Service Tax and Excise Duty will be brought under GST ambit and added that "our government has fulfilled the dreams of traders."</p><br />
 <p> <span style="color:yellow">"Once it (GST) is implemented from April 1, 2017, it will further increase the economic might of India in the world. It is a bold step taken by the government," </span> he said.</p><br />
 <p>He said earlier there were many obstacles in the path of the country on the economic front.</p><br />
 <p> "There were many obstacles and the Modi government removed all of these. After two-and-a-half years (of rule), today we are the fastest growing economy in the world," he said.
</p><br />
 <p> Without naming Congress, Shah alleged that the successive governments at the Centre allegedly failed to create enough employment opportunities and said those who framed the policies earlier were unaware that the country also belonged to businessmen and small traders.</p><br />

  <iframe width="450" height="345" align="left" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3dKXSUPAroA">
   </iframe><br />
  <p><strong>HYDERABAD: A tribal research scholar at the English and Foreign Languages University (EFLU), Hyderabad, has approached the Central government for help alleging that the varsity has discriminated against him on the basis of caste. University officials, however, say he failed to qualify for a degree.</strong></p><br />
  <p> M Sriramulu, who belongs to the Lambada caste and is attached to EFLU's German studies department, alleged that the university has held back his degree certificate and, consequently, he is unable to claim a fellowship to pursue a PhD at EFLU. <span style="color:red"> "I am the country's first tribal student who qualified for the UGC NET in the German language and a JRF (junior research fellowship). However, I am unable to pursue a PhD as the university has not issued my certificate for my five-year integrated course in German," <span>Sriramulu told TOI.</p><br />
  <p> In representations submitted to President Pranab Mukherjee, PM Narendra Modi, the HRD ministry, ministry of tribal affairs and the National Human Rights Commission, the student has alleged the university conspired against him by failing him in eight papers in German despite knowing that he had been in hospital with several ailments in 2013 and, therefore, had been unable to take most of the exams.</p><br />
  <p> In 2013, Sriramalu filed two cases against the dean of the School of Germanic Studies.<span style="color:green"> "I appeared for the supplementary exam. Despite clearing the exam with 68%, the university kept my original academic documents with them. Even my room, which has other supporting documents, such as my passport and driving licence, among other things, remains locked," </span> said Sriramulu.</p><br />
  <p> Reacting to the allegations, John Matthew, an assistant professor at EFLU's German studies department, said the student did not fulfil the eligibility conditions for admission. "The student failed in his integrated course, due to which he cannot be given admission to aPhD course," Mathew said.</p><br />
  <p> EFLU proctor Prakash Kona told TOI that Sriramulu had been raising baseless allegations against the VC for the past three years. <span style="color:orange">"The truth is that he failed to fulfil the minimum requirement to get a degree. He linked every little issue to his caste,"</span> he said.</p><br />
